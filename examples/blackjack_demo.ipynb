    "## Conclusions and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We've Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook showcased a sophisticated **Active Inference** agent playing blackjack using:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle**: The agent minimizes prediction errors by continuously updating beliefs\n",
    "2. **Michael Levin's Goal-Directed Behavior**: The agent pursues long-term objectives through competent navigation\n",
    "3. **Bayesian Inference**: Probabilistic reasoning under uncertainty for optimal decision-making\n",
    "4. **Adaptive Learning**: The agent improves its strategy based on experience\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Advantages of Active Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Principled Decision Making**: Based on solid theoretical foundations from neuroscience\n",
    "- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Explicit modeling of uncertainty in beliefs and predictions\n",
    "- **Adaptive Behavior**: Continuous learning and strategy refinement\n",
    "- **Goal-Oriented**: Pursues long-term objectives, not just immediate rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "Try modifying the parameters to explore different behaviors:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Experiment with different risk tolerances\n",
    "run_simulation(num_games=500, risk_tolerance=0.1)  # Very conservative\n",
    "run_simulation(num_games=500, risk_tolerance=0.5)  # Moderate risk\n",
    "run_simulation(num_games=500, risk_tolerance=0.9)  # High risk\n",
    "\n",
    "# Try different game configurations\n",
    "game = BlackjackGame(num_decks=1, min_bet=10.0, max_bet=500.0)  # Single deck, high stakes\n",
    "game = BlackjackGame(num_decks=8, min_bet=1.0, max_bet=25.0)    # Casino-style, low stakes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-Agent Tournaments**: Agents competing against each other\n",
    "2. **Real-Time Learning**: Online adaptation during gameplay\n",
    "3. **Explainable AI**: Visualizing the agent's decision-making process\n",
    "4. **Poker Implementation**: Extending to Texas Hold'em with opponent modeling\n",
    "5. **Human Studies**: Comparing AI performance against human experts\n",
